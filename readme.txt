AdQuire is a simple and user-friendly ad solution that monetizes your readers by engaging them with top brands while keeping them on your site.

== Description ==

Whether you're looking for your first on-site monetization strategy or already have a robust and varied collection of ad solutions, AdQuire is the answer to your revenue-generating needs.

**Just starting to explore how to make money from your blog?** AdQuire provides you with ease-of-implementation, minimal-to-zero upkeep, and name brands your readers will love.

**Have a variety of existing advertising initiatives and looking for ways to add new revenue?** AdQuire is the perfect complement - specializing in monetizing user actions and experiences that other solutions do not.

### How It Works

While most available plugin options rely on display impressions and could be perceived as intrusive to readers, AdQuire is strategically placed to show after they take a requested on-site action. Typically, those include:

* New Member Registration
* Newsletter/Email Alert Sign Up
* Contest Entry
* Post-Purchase
* And More...

As the reader completes any of these actions, AdQuire positions opt-in ads as a reward or "Thank You" to them for doing so.

**The end result? Better engagement and a more positive reader experience on your site.**
